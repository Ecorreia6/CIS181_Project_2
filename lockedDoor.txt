This is kinda a test story, so to get to the key, go left. To get to the lock, go right. (Ye = left, N = right).
false
You found the key! (Key obtained, play again to get secret ending!)
true
You found the hidden door, you can only enter after getting the key! (key = enter with key, N = give up)
false
Yay, you did it, it worked!
true
Welp, get the key then come back in the same runthrough of the code.
true
