Math time! Are you ready? (y = yes, n = no)
false
Alrighty, what is the correct answer to 3x+7=34? (y = 9, n = 8)
false
Very well done, now a bit harder… What is the derivative of 6x^2+17x+152? (y = 2x^3+(17/2)x^2+152x+C, n = 12x+17)
false
Sorry that is incorrect, see you next time!
true
Correct! It seems we need to keep it up, what is the meaning of life? (y = to go to Clint’s class, n = IDK, what kind of math question even is this?)
false
Very true, smart answer. Now finally a popular problem, what is the answer to this: 6/2(1+2)? (y = 1, n = 9)
false
You got so far, but forgot to use PEMDAS… better luck next time!
true
Wahoo! You did it, Well done! The end.
true
While “idk” is a valid answer normally, it is rude to be mean towards the questioner… have fun starting from the beginning again!
true
Not quite, try again!
true
Uhhh… well… try again when you are ready then.
true
